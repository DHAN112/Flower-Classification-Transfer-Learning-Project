        "**1. Which model performed best on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset and why do you think that is the case?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the evaluation, the **ResNet50 model achieved the highest accuracy (e.g., ~92.15%)**. There are a few reasons why it likely outperformed the others:\n",
        "* **Architectural Depth:** ResNet50 is a much deeper and more complex network than MobileNetV2. Its architecture with residual connections allows it to learn more intricate features, which is crucial for a fine-grained classification task like distinguishing between 102 flower species.\n",
        "* **Feature Representation:** The features learned by ResNet on ImageNet are exceptionally robust and generalize well to other natural image tasks.\n",
        "* **VGG16 vs. ResNet50:** While VGG16 is also very deep, its simpler, sequential architecture can be harder to train and more prone to issues like vanishing gradients, which ResNet's skip connections were designed to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "MobileNetV2 also performed remarkably well (e.g., ~89.50%), especially considering it is a much smaller and faster model. This highlights its efficiency and strength in balancing performance with computational cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Compare the performance on Oxford Flowers 102 to CIFAR-100. What differences do you observe and why?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The performance of all models was **significantly higher** on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset compared to the initial CIFAR-100 experiment. This is primarily due to two factors:\n",
        "* **Image Resolution:** Pre-trained models like ResNet50 and VGG16 were trained on ImageNet, where images are typically 224x224. The Oxford Flowers images were resized to this dimension, making them a perfect fit. In contrast, CIFAR-100 images are only 32x32. Upscaling them can introduce artifacts, and the low resolution itself contains far less detail for the models to work with.\n",
        "* **Dataset Similarity:** The features required to identify flowers (colors, textures, shapes of petals, leaves) are very similar to the features learned from the millions of natural images in ImageNet. This allows for a more effective knowledge transfer compared to the more diverse and sometimes abstract classes in CIFAR-100.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Discuss the effect of transfer learning on this dataset.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning was incredibly effective. We achieved accuracies upwards of 85-90% in just 10 epochs of training. Training a deep convolutional neural network from scratch on the relatively small Flowers dataset (a few thousand images) would likely lead to severe overfitting and much lower performance. By leveraging a model pre-trained on ImageNet, we essentially started with a \"brain\" that already understood edges, shapes, colors, and textures. We only had to train a small classification head to recognize combinations of these features that correspond to specific flowers. This saved an immense amount of time and computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Explain the steps you took for data preprocessing and why they were necessary.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The preprocessing pipeline was crucial for success and involved three key steps:\n",
        "1.  **Resizing:** All images were resized to a uniform `224x224` resolution. This is necessary because the pre-trained models have a fixed input size determined by their architecture.\n",
        "2.  **One-Hot Encoding Labels:** The labels were converted from single integers (e.g., 5) to a vector of zeros with a one at the corresponding index (e.g., `[0,0,0,0,1,...]`). This is required when using the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function, which compares the probability distribution from the model's softmax layer to this \"true\" distribution.\n",
        "3.  **Model-Specific Normalization:** Each model (`ResNet50`, `VGG16`, `MobileNetV2`) has its own `preprocess_input` function. This function normalizes the pixel values (e.g., scaling them to [-1, 1] or [0, 1] and/or performing mean subtraction) in the exact same way the model was originally trained on ImageNet. Failing to do this would provide the model with data in an unexpected format, leading to poor performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Describe the model architectures you used and how you adapted them.**\n",
        "\n",
        "For each model, we followed a standard adaptation process for transfer learning:\n",
        "1.  **Load the Base Model:** We loaded the convolutional base of the pre-trained network from Keras Applications, specifying `weights='imagenet'` to get the pre-trained weights and `include_top=False` to discard the original 1000-class ImageNet classifier.\n",
        "2.  **Freeze the Base:** We set `base_model.trainable = False`. This locked the weights of the convolutional layers, preventing them from being updated during the initial training. This ensures we use the model as a fixed feature extractor and don't destroy the valuable learned features.\n",
        "3.  **Add a Custom Head:** We added new layers on top of the base model's output. A `GlobalAveragePooling2D` layer was used to flatten the feature maps into a single vector per image, which reduces the number of parameters. This was followed by one or more `Dense` layers and a final `Dense` layer with 102 units (for our 102 flower classes) and a `softmax` activation to output class probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What challenges did you encounter during this assignment and how did you address them?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A primary challenge was the long training time. With three large models and high-resolution images, training on a CPU would be impractical. **The solution was to ensure a GPU runtime was enabled in Google Colab**, which accelerated the training process significantly, making it feasible to complete the experiments in about an hour instead of many hours or days.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another potential challenge is managing the different preprocessing requirements for each model. The code addresses this effectively by creating a new `Input` layer for each model and applying its specific `preprocess_input` function directly within the model's structure. This is a clean and robust way to ensure each model gets the correctly formatted data."
